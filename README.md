## About the Video Course
In this course, you will start by setting up your development environment, including downloading Python and setting up your IDE (PyCharm); you'll then be introduced to Python lists and list comprehensions. The course will then show you what a generator is and why you might want to use one. Further on, you will be introduced to functions and decorators, and see how you can use them. You will then learn how to create a very simple, single-file Python program, and how to execute it both from the command line and from within the IDE. You'll also get a very brief introduction to debugging.
